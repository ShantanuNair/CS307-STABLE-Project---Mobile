# CS307
This is our semester-long project for CS 307 Software Engineering, which will help veterinarians keep track of treatment records, as well as provide reminders about upcoming appointments. To accomplish these goals, we will create an ambitious and fully-featured web app.

# Directions for adding Calendar Events using Brackets Live Preview:

1.	Go to File>Project Settings and type
	"http://localhost:8000/" for the Live Preview Base URL.
2.	Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and click
	Download Python 3.5.1
3.	Select the option to add Python to PATH
4.	Open Command Prompt
5.	Navigate to directory where your project files and html are stored
6.	Run the command "py -m http.server 8000"
7.	Then you can run the Live Preview for CalendarPage.html

This is all because Google Calendar API will only work from port 8000
